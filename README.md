Understanding the emotional landscape of mental health discussions is crucial, especially during global crises such as COVID-19. This project analyzes sentiment trends in Reddit posts discussing mental health conditions across different time periods: pre-COVID, COVID, and post-COVID. The goal is to investigate whether sentiment trends vary across these periods and whether different mental health issues exhibit distinct sentiment patterns. 
      For this study, we used an open-source Reddit dataset from Hugging Face, containing discussions      
from subreddits such as r/depression, r/OCD, r/PTSD, r/Aspergerâ€™s, and r/ADHD. The dataset was processed to remove missing values and categorized into three COVID periods based on post timestamps. Sentiment analysis was conducted using the TextBlob library, classifying posts as positive, negative, or neutral based on sentiment polarity scores. Additionally, a Chi-Square test was applied to assess the statistical significance of sentiment trends across COVID periods and different mental health conditions. The results show a significant increase in negative sentiment during COVID, reflecting emotional distress, while positive sentiment increased post-COVID, indicating recovery and community support. Neutral sentiment remained dominant throughout, reflecting informational discussions. The Chi-Square test confirmed a significant association between sentiment and both COVID periods and mental health issues.  These findings highlight the long-term emotional effects of the pandemic and emphasize the need for mental health support strategies tailored to evolving emotional trends. The study provides insights that can help policymakers, researchers, and mental health professionals better understand digital mental health discussions and design targeted interventions.
